deep learning...the hard way with cpp

Ideas of things of interest - parallel processing of linear regression and neural networks
from the ground up. That is:
1. sequential compute
2. parallel cpu compute with varying number of threads - understand the runtime as a function of threads for different problem sizes.
3. gpu compute
